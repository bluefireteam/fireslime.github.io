# Fireslime website

This is just our static front page. It's deployed [here](https://fireslime.xyz).

Built using Jekyll and love.

## Instructions

Install Ruby (with RVM preferably), I'm using **ruby-2.6.3** right now.

Install the bundler if you haven't already and run

```bash
    bundle install # to install deps
    bundle exec jekyll server # to run local dev server
```

To deploy, just push to the master branch, no build is necessary (it might take a few seconds for Github to do its thing).

To contribute, just open an issue/PR ;)
