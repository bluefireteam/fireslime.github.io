It has been a long time since we started the development of Tales of a Lost Mine (TOALM), about 6 months already, and now I think I must start register our progress, I am planning on doing this every two weeks at least.

For people who still didn't heard of TOALM, it will be a Metroidvania mobile game (at least initially), it will be a retro styled game and we hope to bring some elements of old games of that genre for mobile.

So in the past months we have been working hard on finishing a demo for the game and making most of the game systems working, all the game's physics is working, the map rendering system is almost complete, and the UI has progressed a lot as well.

A lot of work has been done on our engine as well, we are using an engine built on top of Flutter, a Google framework for building multiplatform mobile apps, if you like tech stuff, check out the engine here [flame](https://github.com/luanpotter/flame).

Our next steps is to polish even more our demo, work more on trying to build a community for the game and hopefully create more content, like maps, enemies and etc.

Thanks for reading this, and I hope to see you on our next dev log.
