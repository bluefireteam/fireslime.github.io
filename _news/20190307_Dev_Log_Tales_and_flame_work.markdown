Greetings everyone!

This last couple of weeks has been pretty busy, like we said on the previous devlog we have returned developing Tales of a Lost Mine, and we did a lot of progress.

Among some technical improvements we have also added the second gear upgrade for the character, the steam boots, a very strange device that releases a stream of steam, enabling our hero to give a second jump, and thus reaching higher places, you can check some teaser of it below:

We have also worked on some new cool features for Flame, the flutter game engine that we maintain. We did a lot of improvements on the Audio api, which was causing serious problems on the game perfomance when playing a lot of small sounds at the same time.

In addition to that, there is now support for Aseprite animations directy on the engine. That means that you can now create your sprite animation entirely on Aseprite, use its sprite sheet feature to export the image, and its data, and just import that on Flame.

We hope to be releasing a new version of Flame on next week, stay tuned for more information.

That is all for today, thanks for reading this, and hope to see you on our next update.
