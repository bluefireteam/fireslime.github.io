Hello!

More two weeks have passed, and more progress on Tales of a Lost Mine. This time we bring to you news about a new region that we are adding to the game, with an industrial theme!

A new tileset have been draw, and also some new great mechanics have been implemented, among them there is the conveyor belt and a robot that resets a room to its original state. The later will be used so the player can have a second chance when he or she has messed up in a puzzle.
