Hello for another Fireslime's DevLog. In this entry we have some good, and some bad news. The bad news is that Tales of a Lost Mine was put on hold for a while, the good news is that this happened because we would like to finish an unfinished game before continuing with Tales' development.

Break Guns Using Gems is a casual mobile game, where you control a robot, while avoiding bullets and obstacle you must collect gems to buy barriers and with them, destroy the evil guns, it is a game very easy to start playing, but really hard to master, check out the [game page](/games/bgug.html) for screenshots.

We hope to hit Google Play still by the end of this month, so stay tuned for more information!
